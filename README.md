# Palin's Web 1 Assignment - Ara Wines

## About

This is a project for Otago Polytechnic BIT Year 1 Intro To Web. I will be recreating <https://www.arawines.co.nz/home>

This repo also includes the in class website and some of the class homework in branches

### Technologies

This website uses ES6 JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Bugs

- Mobile mode popout menu incorrectly formatted
- Slightly different font used
- Collage image sizing is more uniform than the original page

## Roadmap

The features that I have not yet implemented are as follows:

- Mobile mode page opening effect
- Heart buttons on collage
- Other pages of the website
- Slight scroll back and forward on collage
- Cookie notification popup
- Repeating image scrolling on Cool Climate Wine and Our Latest Release sections
